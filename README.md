# LifeLog
## A Personal Activity Logging and Reflection Application

The **LifeLog** application is a Java desktop application that allows users to record and organize anything they do in their daily lives, such as studying, exercising, spending money, volunteering, or tracking mood and energy levels. Each log entry includes a date, category, description, and an optional numeric value. The application provides summaries over time, helping users review patterns such as how they spend their time, which activities are most frequent, and daily or weekly averages. The project will be developed in stages, starting as a console-based program and later expanding into a graphical user interface while maintaining a clear separation between the data model and the user interface.

This application is intended for **general users** who want a simple and flexible way to reflect on their daily activities without being limited to a single type of tracker. I am interested in this project because it combines structured data with everyday human behavior, and it allows me to practice core Java concepts such as object-oriented design, collections, file input/output, and program state persistence. I also like that the project can grow in complexity over time while remaining approachable and useful.

### Planned Features
- Log daily activities with categories and optional numeric values  
- View summaries such as totals, averages, and most frequent activities  
- Save and reload all logged data to continue using the application later  
- Transition from a **console-based interface** to a **graphical user interface**

## User Stories

- **As a user, I want to be able to add a new log entry to my LifeLog**, specifying the date, category, short description, and an optional numeric value, so that I can record anything I do during the day.  

- **As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all log entries in my LifeLog**, so that I can review what I have recorded over time.  

- **As a user, I want to be able to view log entries filtered by category or by date**, so that I can focus on specific types of activities or a particular day.  

- **As a user, I want to be able to remove a log entry from my LifeLog**, so that I can correct mistakes or delete entries I no longer want to keep.  

- **As a user, I want to be able to see summary statistics about my log entries**, such as totals and averages by category, so that I can better understand my daily habits and patterns.
