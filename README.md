# LifeLog

## A Personal Activity Logging and Reflection Application

**LifeLog** is a Java desktop application that allows users to record and organize anything they do in their daily lives, such as studying, exercising, spending money, volunteering, or tracking mood and energy levels. Each log entry includes a date, category, description, and an optional numeric value. The application provides summaries over time, helping users review patterns such as how they spend their time, which activities are most frequent, and daily or weekly averages. The project will be developed in stages, starting as a console-based program and later expanding into a graphical user interface while maintaining a clear separation between the data model and the user interface.

This application is intended for **general users** who want a simple and flexible way to reflect on their daily activities without being limited to a single type of tracker. I am interested in this project because it combines structured data with everyday human behavior, and it allows me to practice core Java concepts such as object-oriented design, collections, file input/output, and program state persistence. I also like that the project can grow in complexity over time while remaining approachable and useful.

### Planned Features
- Log daily activities with categories and optional numeric values  
- View summaries such as totals, averages, and most frequent activities  
- Save and reload all logged data to continue using the application later  
- Transition from a **console-based interface** to a **graphical user interface**
